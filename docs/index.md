# CausalPipe Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **CausalPipe**, a Python package that simplifies causal discovery and analysis. CausalPipe wraps around **Causal-Learn** and **Lavaan** to provide an easy-to-use, step-by-step process for performing causal analysis.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing data with multiple imputation, standardizes variables, and encodes categorical variables.
- **Causal Discovery**: Construct causal graphs using methods like Fast Adjacency Search (FAS) or Bootstrap-based Causal Structure Learning (BCSL).
- **Edge Orientation**: Use algorithms such as Fast Causal Inference (FCI) or Hill Climbing to orient edges in causal graphs.
- **Causal Effect Estimation**: Estimate effects using methods such as Partial Correlation, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), or kernel methods.
- **Visualization**: Visualize correlation graphs, causal graphs, and SEM results.
